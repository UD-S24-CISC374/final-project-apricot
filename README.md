Jungle Quest follows a cute jaguar character and a band of colorful monkeys through a series of levels that teach the programming concepts of classes and if-statements. In level 1, the player must fill in the blanks of a class declaration with the correct descriptive word based on the image of a cartoon monkey. Level 2 introduces if-statements, so that you fill in the blank based on both the result of the conditional and the appearance of the monkey. The third and final level continues with if-statements, however, the result of the conditional determines which simple action, such as feeding bananas to a monkey, you must complete to progress. If you complete the wrong action, the level resets.

# Basic Instructions

To complete levels 1 and 2, drag the word that correctly matches the description of the on-screen monkey to the corresponding blank in the class declaration. Be sure to think carefully about the logic of the if-statements in level 2. To complete level 3, peform the correct action depending on the result of the if-statement. The actions are written inside a psuedo function call -> action(). Don't forget to find the collectables hidden in each level's enviornment
