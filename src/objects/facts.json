Chameleons that hang out in trees are usually green, while those that live in deserts are most often brown.", "Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.", "Chameleons can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees. This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to! This is useful because it means they can see predators coming from behind them.", "Excluding their tail, some chameleons’ tongues can be twice the length of their body. Their tongues consist of both muscles and bones, and can bend round to grab their pray."]

They just sleep on whatever branch they feel safe in!"]
